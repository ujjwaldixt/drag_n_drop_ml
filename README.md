# Drag_n_Drop_ML
- This project aims to improve the process of making machine learning models easier and more accessible to non-programmers.
- The goal is to let the user drag and drop "components". A component is a piece that holds some information about the data on which the model is being trained.
- Users can "link" several of these components to train their ML model.
